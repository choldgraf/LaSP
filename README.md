* What is LaSP?
LaSP stands for - - Learning and Signal Processing- - . It's a Python wrapper some awesome machine learning and signal processing open source packages. It provides an educational environment to learn how to use these tools based on [http://www.ipython.org IPython].

The plan is to cover the following topics by Fall 2014:

- Introduction to Machine Learning
- Probability and Maximum Likelihood
- Gradient Descent
- Linear Models
- Neural Networks
- Principle Components Analysis
- Independent Components Analysis
- Clustering: k-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Spectral Graph Methods
- Time Series - Covariance and Correlation Functions
- Time Series- Fourier Transform and Time-Frequency Representations
- Time Series - Coherence
- Singular Value Decomosition
- Sparse Dictionaries

* TODO

# Get virtual-environment setup documented and working automatically
# Get setup.py filled in
# Document ALL functions!
# Get unit tests running from setup.py
# Implement IPython notebook for intro to ML

* INSTALLATION
Coming soon!

* DOCUMENTATION and TUTORIALS
Coming soon!
