# What is LaSP?
LaSP stands for *Learning and Signal Processing*. It provides an educational environment to learn how to use some of the awesome open source machine learning and signal processing packages out there. The tutorials are based on [IPython](http://www.ipython.org). Installation dependencies can be managed through a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io) to simplify your experience.

The plan is to cover the following topics by Fall 2014:

- Introduction to Machine Learning
- Probability and Maximum Likelihood
- Gradient Descent
- Linear Models
- Neural Networks
- Principle Components Analysis
- Independent Components Analysis
- Clustering: k-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Spectral Graph Methods
- Time Series - Covariance and Correlation Functions
- Time Series- Fourier Transform and Time-Frequency Representations
- Time Series - Coherence
- Singular Value Decomosition
- Sparse Dictionaries

# TODO

We are in the process of projectizing old code, trying to follow the best practices detailed [here](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/). Some of the steps we need to take are:

1. Get virtual-environment setup documented and working automatically
2. Get setup.py filled in
3. Document ALL functions!
4. Get unit tests running from setup.py
5. Implement IPython notebook for intro to ML

# INSTALLATION
Coming soon!

# DOCUMENTATION and TUTORIALS
Coming soon!
